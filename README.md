## Project Structure

I'm handling each day by creating an object dedicated to solving that problem, Instantiating the days object (day 1 is an exception as it used two seperate objects for each part) and calling the getResult function will return that days result.

## Current progress:
- Day 1
  - Part 1: Completed
  - Part 2: Completed
- Day 2
  - Part 1: Completed
  - Part 2: Abandoned (For now...)
- Day 3
  - Part 1: Work in progress...
